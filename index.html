<div class="panel">
<p>The Ford Fiesta ST is a fun, affordable hot hatch with agile handling and impressive performance for its size. Ford really hit the nail on the head when creating this masterpiece. <br> It may not be the fastest in a straight line, but the backroads is where this pocket rocket truly shines. <br> This little hot hatch is a true favorite of ours!</p>

<button class="accordion">Our opinion on the Toyota GR Yaris &#128072;</button>      
<div class="panel">
<p>The GR Yaris is a rally-inspired powerhouse, delivering a thrilling driving experience with an AWD system and turbocharged punch. <br> Managing to squeeze such high horespower out of a tiny 3 cylinder engine is truly an engineering masterpiece from Toyota. <br> Being one of the few manual hot hatches still in production, we can't help but praise this car! </p>

<h3>&#10024; Lamborghini Revuelto &#10024;</h3>

<p><b>Engine:</b> 6.5L V12 Hybrid &nbsp;|&nbsp; <b>0-60mph:</b> 2.5s &nbsp;|&nbsp; <b>Price when new:</b> £400,000 &nbsp;|&nbsp; <b>BHP:</b> 814 &nbsp;|&nbsp; <b>Torque:</b> 725 Nm</p>

<!-- Accordion button for our Lamborghini Revuelto opinion, when clicked it opens -->
<button class="accordion">Our opinion on the Lamborghini Revuelto &#128072;</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The Revuelto combines stunning power with hybrid efficiency, a true marvel of modern engineering and Italian design. <br> This car was given the difficult task of replacing Lamborghinis previous V12 model, the Aventador. <br> While some people are not happy with its hybrid system, we believe the power delivery it creates puts this car in a league of its own. Lamborghini knew what they were doing when creating this beast! </p>

<button class="accordion">Our opinion on the Ferrari SF90 &#128072;</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>With nearly 1000 horsepower, the SF90 is a the epitome of what Ferrari stands for; elegance, handling and raw power. <br> This car was designed to bring Ferrari’s F1 racing pedigree to the road, and we have to agree. <br> The rumble of its mighty V8 is unmatched, and carries that iconic Ferrari exhaust tone. This car is something Enzo Ferrari himself would be proud of.</p>

<!-- Accordion button for our M4 CS opinion, when clicked it opens -->
<button class="accordion">Our opinion on the BMW M4 CS &#128072;</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The M4 CS is a finely-tuned performance machine, delivering an exhilarating rear-wheel drive experience. <br> BMW realised that their already existing M4 model was performing well on the market, and decided to make an exclusive model that took all of its best features and enhanced them. <br> With even more brutish German power, better handling and improved styling, this car stands out as being one of the companys best models in recent years. </p>

<!-- Accordion button for our RS6 opinion, when clicked it opens -->
<button class="accordion">Our opinion on the Audi RS6 &#128072;</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The RS6 is a performance wagon icon, blending practicality with power for the ultimate daily driver. <br> Your kids will never be late to school again thanks to the beastly V8 this car is equipped with. <br>Furthermore, its weight and suspension setup make the car extremely comfortable. However, dont get too comfy, because putting your foot down will quickly wake you up!</p>
